This Data set contains 3000+ entries for all courses data & subjects in Udemy application which we need to investigate to answer questions about subscribers and courses prices
How many courses for each subject is udemy offering?

Some of our conclusions was:

* Most selling books are for Web development
* These are the Book tites that was published in 2015 Concepts of Statistics For Beginners Step by Step','10 Numbers Every Business Owner Should Know','101 Blues riffs - learn how the harmonica superstars do it', ...,'Your Own Site in 45 Min: The Complete Wordpress Course','Your Second Course on Piano: Two Handed Playing','Zend Framework 2: Learn the PHP framework ZF2 from scratch.
* Maximum number of subscribers is for web develoment subject
* We can interpret from the visual and pearson correlation coefficient value of 0.15 that there is almost no relationship between number of subscribers and number of lectures
* We can interpret from the visual and the pearson correlation coefficient value of 0.051 that there is almost no relationship between increase in the price and increaseinn number of subscribers
* The visual and the pearson correlation of 0.33 shows that here is a moderate relationship between Price and number of lectures which means as the number of lectures increases the price slightly increases
